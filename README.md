# Advent-of-Code-2022 🎄🧝

Welcome to my repository for this years [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)! 

Puzzle inputs and descriptions are not included in this repository. You'll have to get these yourself from the AoC website. Here's why.

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets 
and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.
