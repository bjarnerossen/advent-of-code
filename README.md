# Advent of Code 🎄🧝

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming puzzles, which consist of 25 days of challenges to be solved using any programming language. For this year, I chose to use Python3.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Getting started 🦌

1. 📥 Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

via _https_

```
git clone https://github.com/bjarnerossen/Advent-of-Code.git
```

via _ssh_

```
git clone git@github.com:bjarnerossen/Advent-of-Code.git
```

2. 📂 Navigate to the corresponding directory and execute the Python script:

```terminal
cd day01
python3 main.py
```

> Note that the input data and puzzle descriptions are not included in this repository, so you will need to download them from the Advent of Code website yourself. [Here's why](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/k99rod/sharing_input_data_were_we_requested_not_to/).

## Files

The repository is organized into directories named after the corresponding day of the Advent calendar. Inside each directory, you will find a Python script with the solution to the puzzle for that day.

```
dayXX/
├─ main.py
```
