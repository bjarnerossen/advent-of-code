# Advent of Code 🕯️🕯️🕯️🕯️

This repository contains my solutions for the awesome [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming puzzles, a series of 25 challenges designed to test programming skills in any language.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Required for the 2022 and 2023 solutions.
- **Go**: Required for the 2024 solutions.

## Getting Started 🦌

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

#### Clone via HTTPS

```
git clone https://github.com/bjarnerossen/advent-of-code.git
```
#### Clone via SSH

```
git clone git@github.com:bjarnerossen/advent-of-code.git
```

2. Navigate to the corresponding directory and execute the Python script:

#### For Python (2022/2023)
```terminal
cd day01
python3 part1.py
```

#### For Go (2024)
```terminal
cd day01
go run part1.go
```

> Note that the input data and puzzle descriptions are not included in this repository, so you will need to download them from the Advent of Code website yourself. [Here's why](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/k99rod/sharing_input_data_were_we_requested_not_to/).

#### Files

The repository is organized into directories named after the corresponding day of the Advent calendar. Inside each directory, you will find a Python script with the solution to the puzzle for that day.

#### Example File Structure
```
2022/dayXX/
├─ part1.py
├─ part2.py
```
